This small app displays a message on the home route '/' on port 8080. The app runs on Express.js.

The solution was created using the gloud CLI to create a new Google App Engine.
The solution uses a cheap instance on the [INSERT ZONE] zone.

A .yaml file defines how the app should be run. A package.json file specifies dependencies and
scripts which can be executed.

The app gets deployed using the CLI directly to the App Engine.
